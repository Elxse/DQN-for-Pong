# Learning to play Pong with DQN

In this project, we implement the Deep Q-Network (DQN) introduced by  [Mnih et al. (2015)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf) and eventually learn to play Pong. 
The project consists of three phases: understanding the algorithm, implementing and testing the algorithm on a simple problem (CartPole environment), and using it to learn to play Pong. 

This project is part of the [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/exchange/courses/list/syllabus/?kpid=41717&lasar=21%2F22&typ=1) course at Uppsala University.
